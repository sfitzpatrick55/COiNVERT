# COiNVERT
By: `Scott Fitzpatrick`

## Description
COiNVERT is a straight-forward web application that aims to educate people about cryptocurrency by allowing them to convert a US dollar amount to five popular cryptocurrencies at the same time.

## Target audience
This app is perfect for anyone who is new to cryptocurrency and would like to explore how conversion rates change in real time.

## Reasoning
I chose this project because of my interest in cryptocurrencies, blockchain and fluctuating market values. I hope to expand the functionality of this application in future releases.
